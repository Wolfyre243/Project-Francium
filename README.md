# Introduction
What is Project Francium? Well, I don't really know either.
It's a large collection of different modules that, together, form an AI assistant/friend.
More details on the different modules can be found via the submodule linkages I've made for them.

This project is an experiment for me to learn many many crucial concepts, such as Docker, LLMs, APIs and more.
The learning curve is surely steep, but someone's gotta do it, one way or another...
I hope that this project will teach me important concepts to prepare me for actual projects.

Please leave a star if you found my stuff cool!!! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

As for the project name, I named it after the most reactive chemical element because its been giving me explosive headaches, as if I consumed francium itself...
